# MVC Practice
MVC is known as an architectural pattern, which embodies three parts Model, View and Controller, or to be more exact it divides the application into three logical parts: the model part, the view and the controller. It was used for desktop graphical user interfaces but nowadays is used in designing mobile apps and web apps.
